# Capstone_project(Spam_filter)
Three main datasets is investigated:

Primary Kaggle dataset: [Enron Spam Data (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marcelwiechmann/enron-spam-data)

Second dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jackksoncsie/spam-email-dataset

Third open dataset : https://huggingface.co/datasets/UniqueData/email-spam-classification

We use three open datasets for email spam classification. Our main corpus is the Enron Spam Data from Kaggle, which is a single CSV combining the six Enron‑Spam datasets introduced by Metsis et al. (CEAS 2006) and built from real Enron mailboxes plus injected spam from external sources. As a second dataset we use Kaggle’s Spam email Dataset (emails.csv), a 5,728‑message corpus originally assembled for MITx’s Analytics Edge course, where ham messages come from Enron executive Vincent Kaminski’s inbox and spam comes from the SpamAssassin public corpus and Project Honey Pot, with roughly a 75/25 ham–spam split. Finally, we include the UniqueData email‑spam‑classification dataset from HuggingFace, a small (84‑email) vendor‑curated sample of English emails labeled as spam or not spam, provided under a CC BY‑NC‑ND 4.0 license as an example of the commercial datasets offered by the vendor.
